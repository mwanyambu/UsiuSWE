        <h2>HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
        <p>
            When browsing the web, you might have noticed URLs starting with http. It is either ‘http://’ or ‘https://’.
            Such prefixes show how data is transmitted between your browser and the website that you are accessing.
            HTTP and HTTPS are both protocols for communication but they are different in several ways and the main difference is security.
        </p>
        <p>HTTP and HTTPS are protocols that are used in the web to transfer data. HTTPS is more secure since it is encrypted and authenticated.
            HTTP is recommended for use in delivering non-sensitive information and is adequate for this job,
            while HTTPS is important in securing online transactions and the information of the user.
            With the emergence of new technologies the usage of the HTTPS protocol is expected to be the standard for secure browsing.
        </p>
        <h2>FTP vs SFTP</h2>
        <p>
            Data transfer is the most common task in network and system communications, and they involve transfer of files using two means 
            i.e the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). FTP is a commonly applied protocol that enables 
            files to be transferred through a network from one computer to another, but FTP is unsecure it does not have an encrypted channel 
            thus prone to security risks. SFTP on the other hand stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol which is a development of FTP where 
            data encrypted in ensuring that only the systems intended for transfer are the only ones with access to the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            FTP is used for transferring the files from one system to another system more reliably and efficiently.
            while SFTP is a protocol for transferring large files over the web. It could handle sensitive data securely in all situations

                <td>HTTPS is considered to be secure but at the cost of processing time because Web Server and Web Browser need to exchange encryption keys using Certificates before actual data can be transferred.</td>

    <h3>importance of secure communication protocols</h3>
    <p>
        Organizations, both big and small, handle vast amounts of data on a daily basis.
        This data may include personal information, financial records, or trade secrets. 
        Without secure protocols, this data is vulnerable to attacks from cyber criminals 
        who are constantly looking for opportunities to exploit weaknesses in security systems.
        By implementing secure protocols, organizations can ensure that their data remains secure 
        and protected. This not only helps in maintaining the trust of customers and clients but 
        also prevents potential financial losses and reputational damage that can occur as a result 
        of a security breach.They provide a layer of protection that is necessary to safeguard sensitive 
        information and maintain the integrity of data transmitted over networks. By understanding the 
        importance of secure protocols and implementing them effectively, organizations can mitigate the
         risks associated with cyber threats and ensure a secure digital environment for all.
